While value of column is one of three type column name: single, a list or a slice, value of row is filtered by 2 ways: (1) based on index value and (2) based on condition.\nIn the former, index value can be a single or a list of value. In the later, condition is comparison/logical checking of one or more columns. Let see the example:\n\n(1) Select based on index value\n\ndf.loc[[1]] # return the row at index 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\nsalary\ntitle\naddr\n\n\n\n\n1\nB\n77\nNone\n83 PVB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchoose name as a index column\n\n\n# \n# choose `name` as a index column\ndf.set_index('name', inplace=True)\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsalary\ntitle\naddr\n\n\nname\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n100\nMr\n123 LTK\n\n\nB\n77\nNone\n83 PVB\n\n\nC\n80\nMs\n4 CX\n\n\nD\n95\nMrs\n45/6 LDH\n\n\nE\n30\nMr\nNone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nselect single index value\n\n\n#\ndf.loc[['A']]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsalary\ntitle\naddr\n\n\nname\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n100\nMr\n123 LTK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nselect a list of index values\n\n\ndf.loc[['A', 'C']]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsalary\ntitle\naddr\n\n\nname\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n100\nMr\n123 LTK\n\n\nC\n80\nMs\n4 CX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nselect a list of index values and a list of ccolumn names\n\n\n#\ndf.loc[['A', 'C'],  ['salary', 'addr']]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsalary\naddr\n\n\nname\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n100\n123 LTK\n\n\nC\n80\n4 CX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2) Select based on condition\n\nfilter by one condition\n\n\n#\ndf.loc[df.title == 'Mr']\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsalary\ntitle\naddr\n\n\nname\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n100\nMr\n123 LTK\n\n\nE\n30\nMr\nNone\n\n\nF\n45\nMr\nNone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfilter by two conditions\n\n\n#\ndf.loc[(df.salary &gt;= 40) & (df.title == 'Mr')]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsalary\ntitle\naddr\n\n\nname\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n100\nMr\n123 LTK\n\n\nF\n45\nMr\nNone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfilter null value\n\n\n#\n# \ndf.loc[df.salary.isna()]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsalary\ntitle\naddr\n\n\nname\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfilter not null value\n\n\n#\n# filter not null value\ndf.loc[~df.salary.isna()]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsalary\ntitle\naddr\n\n\nname\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n100\nMr\n123 LTK\n\n\nB\n77\nNone\n83 PVB\n\n\nC\n80\nMs\n4 CX\n\n\nD\n95\nMrs\n45/6 LDH\n\n\nE\n30\nMr\nNone\n\n\nF\n45\nMr\nNone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#\ndf.loc[(~df.salary.isna()) & (~df.addr.isna())]\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsalary\ntitle\naddr\n\n\nname\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n100\nMr\n123 LTK\n\n\nB\n77\nNone\n83 PVB\n\n\nC\n80\nMs\n4 CX\n\n\nD\n95\nMrs\n45/6 LDH"
