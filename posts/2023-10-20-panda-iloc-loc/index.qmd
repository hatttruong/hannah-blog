# Diferrent between loc vs iloc in Panda

We often use `loc` and `iloc` to select a subset rows or cells in DataFrame Pandas. Here is the summary of how to use these function:

## Using iloc
In general, `iloc` is used to filter dataframe based on **index** of row and column as below:
  ```
  df.iloc[<row_index>, <column_index>]
  ```
in which `<row_index>`, `<column_index>` can be a single number, a list of numner or a slice `x:y`. 

Noted that:
  - we cannot select based on column name when using `iloc`.
  - we can mix type of `row_index` and `column_index` (they do not need to be the same type)
  - when `row_index` or `column_index` is a single number, put it in a list in order to return a DataFrame; otherwise, it will return a Series

Example:
  ```
  #
  # select a single row
  df.iloc[1] # return a Series
  df.iloc[[1]] # return a df
  # 
  # select a subset continuous row with all columns
  df.iloc[1:3,]
  #
  # select a subset continuous row with a subset columns
  df.iloc[1:3, 2:]
  #
  # select a subset continuous row with one column
  df.iloc[1:3, [2]]   # return df
  df.iloc[1:3, 2]     # return Series
  # 
  # select a subset not continuous row
  df.iloc[[0,2,3]] 
  # select a subset not continuous row & not continuous columns
  df.iloc[[0,2,3], [0, 2]] 
  #
  ```
