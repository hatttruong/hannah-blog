# Setup ENV
A guidline for myself to setup env for ML

**Note: NEVER use python of system => use CONDA or MAMBA to manage python version**

## Mamba: manage python package
- Currently, Mamba is faster than Miniconda, I follow the instruction here to install: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge
  ```

  (base) 192 :: ~ » curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh" bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh
  (base) 192 :: ~ » which python3                                                                                                                                                                         1 ↵

  (base) 192 :: ~ » python3 --version
  Python 3.10.12

  (base) 192 :: ~ » alias python=python3
  (base) 192 :: ~ » which python
  python: aliased to python3
  
  ```
- I use python3.10 because this is version that Google Colab using
- create virtual env
